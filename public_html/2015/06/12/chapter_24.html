<p class="firstparagraph">
    <span class="firstcharacter">N</span>ext day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
    the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the
    duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim
    he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours,
    because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day
    in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all
    alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by
    himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger,
    you know. So the duke said it <i>was</i> kind of hard to have to lay roped all
    day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.
</p>

<p>
    He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He
    dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit&mdash;it was a long curtain-calico
    gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his
    theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over
    a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.
    Blamed if he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.
    Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:
</p>

<p>
    Sick Arab&mdash;but harmless when not out of his head.
</p>

<p>
    And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five
    foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was
    a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling
    all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make
    himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must
    hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like
    a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.
    Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and
    he wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look like he
    was dead, he looked considerable more than that.
</p>

<p>
    These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so
    much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe the
    news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn't hit no
    project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay
    off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up
    something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop
    over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to
    lead him the profitable way&mdash;meaning the devil, I reckon. We
    had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put
    his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course.
    The king's duds was all black, and he did look real swell and
    starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body before.
    Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but
    now, when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a
    smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had
    walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim
    cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There was a big
    steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile
    above the town&mdash;been there a couple of hours, taking on freight.
    Says the king:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.
    Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat,
    Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her."
</p>

<p>
    I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I
    fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting
    along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to a
    nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the
    sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a
    couple of big carpet-bags by him.
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Run her nose in shore," says the king. I done it. "Wher' you
    bound for, young man?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "For the steamboat; going to Orleans."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Git aboard," says the king. "Hold on a minute, my servant 'll he'p
    you with them bags. Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus"&mdash;meaning
    me, I see.
</p>

<div class="fig">
    <img alt="c24-205.jpg (40K)" src="./images/c24-205.jpg"><br>
</div>

<p>
    I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap
    was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such
    weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd
    come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now
    he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The
    young fellow says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come
    mighty near getting here in time.' But then I says again, 'No, I
    reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.' You
    <i>ain't</i> him, are you?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No, my name's Blodgett&mdash;Elexander Blodgett&mdash;<i>Reverend</i> Elexander
    Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants.
    But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not
    arriving in time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it&mdash;which
    I hope he hasn't."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all right;
    but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die&mdash;which he mayn't mind,
    nobody can tell as to that&mdash;but his brother would a give anything in
    this world to see <i>him</i> before he died; never talked about nothing else all
    these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys together&mdash;and
    hadn't ever seen his brother William at all&mdash;that's the deef and dumb
    one&mdash;William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and
    George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married
    brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William's
    the only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here
    in time."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Did anybody send 'em word?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter
    said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time.
    You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to be much
    company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was
    kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem to care
    much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey&mdash;and
    William, too, for that matter&mdash;because he was one of them kind that
    can't bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and
    said he'd told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest
    of the property divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right&mdash;for
    George didn't leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get
    him to put a pen to."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? Wher' does he live?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Oh, he lives in England&mdash;Sheffield&mdash;preaches there&mdash;hasn't
    ever been in this country. He hasn't had any too much time&mdash;and
    besides he mightn't a got the letter at all, you know."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You
    going to Orleans, you say?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. I'm going in a ship, next
    Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "It's a pretty long journey. But it'll be lovely; wisht I was
    a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about fourteen&mdash;that's
    the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they
    ain't going to let them come to no harm. There's Hobson, the Babtis'
    preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and
    Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow
    Bartley, and&mdash;well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones
    that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he
    wrote home; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets
    here."
</p>

<div class="fig">
    <img alt="c24-207.jpg (71K)" src="./images/c24-207.jpg"><br>
</div>

<p>
    Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
    that young fellow. Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and
    everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about
    Peter's business&mdash;which was a tanner; and about George's&mdash;which
    was a carpenter; and about Harvey's&mdash;which was a dissentering
    minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop
    there. When they're deep they won't stop for a hail. A
    Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Was Peter Wilks well off?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it's reckoned
    he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "When did you say he died?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "I didn't say, but it was last night."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Funeral to-morrow, likely?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes, 'bout the middle of the day."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or
    another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes, sir, it's the best way. Ma used to always say that."
</p>

<p>
    When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she
    got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost
    my ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle
    up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new
    carpet-bags. And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there
    and git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove
    along, now."
</p>

<p>
    I see what <i>he</i> was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I
    got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a log,
    and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had said it&mdash;every
    last word of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk
    like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch. I can't
    imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he really done it
    pretty good. Then he says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?"
</p>

<p>
    The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and
    dumb person on the histronic boards. So then they waited for a
    steamboat.
</p>

<p>
    About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but
    they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a
    big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went
    aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to
    go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said
    they wouldn't land us. But the king was ca'm. He says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
    put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?"
</p>

<p>
    So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the
    village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when
    they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?" they give
    a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, "What
    d' I tell you?" Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he <i>did</i> live
    yesterday evening."
</p>

<p>
    Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up
    against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his
    back, and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Alas, alas, our poor brother&mdash;gone, and we never got to see him; oh,
    it's too, too hard!"
</p>

<div class="fig">
    <img alt="c24-209.jpg (56K)" src="./images/c24-209.jpg"><br>
</div>

<p>
    Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the
    duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and bust out
    a-crying. If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that
    ever I struck.
</p>

<p>
    Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all
    sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill
    for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about
    his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on his
    hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner like
    they'd lost the twelve disciples. Well, if ever I struck anything
    like it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human
    race.
