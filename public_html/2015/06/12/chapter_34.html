    <span class="firstcharacter">W</span>e stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by Tom says: "Looky here, Huck,
    what fools we are to not think of it before! I
    bet I know where Jim is."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No! Where?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we
    was at dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What did you think the vittles was for?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "For a dog."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Because part of it was watermelon."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "So it was&mdash;I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never
    thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can
    see and don't see at the same time."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it
    again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got
    up from table&mdash;same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock
    shows prisoner; and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little
    plantation, and where the people's all so kind and good. Jim's the
    prisoner. All right&mdash;I'm glad we found it out detective
    fashion; I wouldn't give shucks for any other way. Now you work your
    mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too;
    and we'll take the one we like the best."
</p>

<p>
    What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer's head I
    wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in
    a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan,
    but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right
    plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Ready?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes," I says.
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "All right&mdash;bring it out."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "My plan is this," I says. "We can easy find out if it's Jim in
    there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from
    the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out
    of the old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the
    river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me
    and Jim used to do before. Wouldn't that plan work?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "<i>Work</i>? Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But
    it's too blame' simple; there ain't nothing <i>to</i> it. What's the good
    of a plan that ain't no more trouble than that? It's as mild as
    goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking
    into a soap factory."
</p>

<p>
    I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but I
    knowed mighty well that whenever he got <i>his</i> plan ready it wouldn't have
    none of them objections to it.
</p>

<p>
    And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was
    worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as
    mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied,
    and said we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what it was here,
    because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was. I knowed he would
    be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
    bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.
</p>

<p>
    Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
    earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
    That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was
    respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
    home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
    knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
    without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this
    business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before
    everybody. I <i>couldn't</i> understand it no way at all. It was
    outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his
    true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save
    himself. And I <i>did</i> start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Don't you reckon I know what I'm about? Don't I generly know what
    I'm about?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Didn't I <i>say</i> I was going to help steal the nigger?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "<i>Well</i>, then."
</p>

<p>
    That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't no use to say
    any more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But
    I couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just
    let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to
    have it so, I couldn't help it.
</p>

<p>
    When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to
    the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the
    yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and
    didn't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything
    comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at
    the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with&mdash;which
    was the north side&mdash;we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high,
    with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Here's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if
    we wrench off the board."
</p>

<p>
    Tom says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing
    hooky. I should <i>hope</i> we can find a way that's a little more
    complicated than <i>that</i>, Huck Finn."
</p>

<div class="fig">
    <img alt="c34-296.jpg (70K)" src="./images/c34-296.jpg"><br>
</div>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, then," I says, "how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done before
    I was murdered that time?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "That's more <i>like</i>," he says. "It's real mysterious, and troublesome,
    and good," he says; "but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.
    There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around."
</p>

<p>
    Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined
    the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as
    the hut, but narrow&mdash;only about six foot wide. The door to it
    was at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the
    soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift
    the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The
    chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and
    struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't
    no connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing
    in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a
    crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the
    staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.
    He says;
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Now we're all right. We'll <i>dig</i> him out. It 'll take about a
    week!"
</p>

<p>
    Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door&mdash;you only
    have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors&mdash;but
    that warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he
    must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about
    three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
    busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he was
    rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time
    he made the trip.
</p>

<p>
    In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to
    pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim&mdash;if it <i>was</i>
    Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through
    breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up a
    tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving,
    the key come from the house.
</p>

<p>
    This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all
    tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off.
    He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making
    him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words
    and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so long before in
    his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his
    troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do. So Tom
    says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?"
</p>

<p>
    The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
    heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en
    look at 'im?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes."
</p>

<p>
    I hunched Tom, and whispers:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "You going, right here in the daybreak? <i>that</i> warn't the plan."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No, it warn't; but it's the plan <i>now</i>."
</p>

<p>
    So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got
    in we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there,
    sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, <i>Huck</i>! En good <i>lan</i>'! ain' dat Misto Tom?"
</p>

<p>
    I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn't know
    nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger
    busted in and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?"
</p>

<p>
    We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady
    and kind of wondering, and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Does <i>who</i> know us?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, dis-yer runaway nigger."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What <i>put</i> it dar? Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed
    you?"
</p>

<p>
    Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, that's mighty curious. <i>Who</i> sung out? <i>when</i> did he sing out?
    <i>what</i> did he sing out?" And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,
    "Did <i>you</i> hear anybody sing out?"
</p>

<p>
    Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing."
</p>

<p>
    Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and
    says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Did you sing out?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No, sah," says Jim; "I hain't said nothing, sah."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Not a word?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No, sah, I hain't said a word."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Did you ever see us before?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No, sah; not as I knows on."
</p>

<p>
    So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
    says, kind of severe:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? What made you
    think somebody sung out?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey's
    awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so. Please
    to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole me; 'kase
    he say dey <i>ain't</i> no witches. I jis' wish to goodness he was heah now&mdash;<i>den</i>
    what would he say! I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun'
    it <i>dis</i> time. But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's <i>sot</i>, stays sot;
    dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en when <i>you</i> fine
    it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you."
</p>

    <img alt="c34-299.jpg (84K)" src="./images/c34-299.jpg"><br>
</div>

<p>
    Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to buy
    some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to
    catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give him
    up, I'd hang him." And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look
    at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and
    says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Don't ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on
    nights, it's us; we're going to set you free."
</p>

<p>
    Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger
    come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us
    to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the
    witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks
    around then.
