    <span class="firstcharacter">I</span>t would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down
    into the woods; because Tom said we got to have <i>some</i> light to see how to
    dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what
    we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called fox-fire, and
    just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place. We
    fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom
    says, kind of dissatisfied:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And
    so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There
    ain't no watchman to be drugged&mdash;now there <i>ought</i> to be a watchman.
    There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And
    there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his
    bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off
    the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the
    punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim
    could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be no
    use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it,
    Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent <i>all</i> the
    difficulties. Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can
    with the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing&mdash;there's more
    honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where
    there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their
    duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own
    head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you
    come down to the cold facts, we simply got to <i>let on</i> that a lantern's
    resky. Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted
    to, I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up
    something to make a saw out of the first chance we get."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What do we want of a saw?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What do we <i>want</i> of it? Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed
    off, so as to get the chain loose?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
    off."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn. You <i>can</i> get up the
    infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain't you ever
    read any books at all?&mdash;Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto
    Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Who ever heard of
    getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the
    way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave
    it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some
    dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't
    see no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly
    sound. Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes;
    slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your
    rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat&mdash;because
    a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know&mdash;and there's your
    horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across
    a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever
    it is. It's gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If
    we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one."
</p>

<p>
    I says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under
    the cabin?"
</p>

<p>
    But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He
    had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes
    his head; then sighs again, and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No, it wouldn't do&mdash;there ain't necessity enough for it."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "For what?" I says.
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, to saw Jim's leg off," he says.
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Good land!" I says; "why, there ain't <i>no</i> necessity for it. And
    what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?"
</p>

<div class="fig">
    <img alt="c35-302.jpg (47K)" src="./images/c35-302.jpg"><br>
</div>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn't get
    the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg
    would be better still. But we got to let that go. There ain't
    necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't
    understand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so we'll
    let it go. But there's one thing&mdash;he can have a rope ladder; we
    can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. And
    we can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way. And I've
    et worse pies."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk," I says; "Jim ain't got no use for a rope
    ladder."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "He <i>has</i> got use for it. How <i>you</i> talk, you better say; you don't know
    nothing about it. He's <i>got</i> to have a rope ladder; they all do."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What in the nation can he <i>do</i> with it?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "<i>Do</i> with it? He can hide it in his bed, can't he?" That's what
    they all do; and <i>he's</i> got to, too. Huck, you don't ever seem to want
    to do anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all
    the time. S'pose he <i>don't</i> do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed,
    for a clew, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews?
    Of course they will. And you wouldn't leave them any? That
    would be a <i>pretty</i> howdy-do, <i>wouldn't</i> it! I never heard of such a
    thing."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well," I says, "if it's in the regulations, and he's got to have it, all
    right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on no regulations;
    but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer&mdash;if we go to tearing up our sheets
    to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble with Aunt
    Sally, just as sure as you're born. Now, the way I look at it, a
    hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and is
    just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag
    ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no experience, and so
    he don't care what kind of a&mdash;"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep still&mdash;that's
    what I'D do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a
    hickry-bark ladder? Why, it's perfectly ridiculous."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my advice,
    you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline."
</p>

<p>
    He said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Borrow a shirt, too."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What do we want of a shirt, Tom?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Want it for Jim to keep a journal on."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Journal your granny&mdash;<i>Jim</i> can't write."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "S'pose he <i>can't</i> write&mdash;he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, if
    we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
    barrel-hoop?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one;
    and quicker, too."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "<i>Prisoners</i> don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens
    out of, you muggins. They <i>always</i> make their pens out of the hardest,
    toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like
    that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and
    months and months to file it out, too, because they've got to do it by
    rubbing it on the wall. <i>They</i> wouldn't use a goose-quill if they had
    it. It ain't regular."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sort and
    women; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim can do that;
    and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to
    let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the bottom of
    a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. The Iron
    Mask always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Jim ain't got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "That ain't nothing; we can get him some."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Can't nobody <i>read</i> his plates."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "That ain't got anything to <i>do</i> with it, Huck Finn. All <i>he's</i> got to
    do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don't <i>have</i> to be
    able to read it. Why, half the time you can't read anything a prisoner
    writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, blame it all, it ain't the <i>prisoner's</i> plates."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "But it's <i>somebody's</i> plates, ain't it?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, spos'n it is? What does the <i>prisoner</i> care whose&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
    He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So
    we cleared out for the house.
</p>

<p>
    Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
    clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down
    and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing,
    because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't
    borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners;
    and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
    don't blame them for it, either. It ain't no crime in a prisoner to
    steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and
    so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
    steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out
    of prison with. He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very
    different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he
    warn't a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was
    that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,
    when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made
    me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for.
    Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we <i>needed</i>. Well,
    I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn't need it to get
    out of prison with; there's where the difference was. He said if I'd
    a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal
    with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I
    couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set
    down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I
    see a chance to hog a watermelon.
</p>

<p>
    Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled
    down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried
    the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. By
    and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk.
    He says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Tools?" I says.
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Tools for what?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, to dig with. We ain't a-going to <i>gnaw</i> him out, are we?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
    nigger out with?" I says.
</p>

<p>
    He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Huck Finn, did you <i>ever</i> hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and
    all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?
    Now I want to ask you&mdash;if you got any reasonableness in you at
    all&mdash;what kind of a show would <i>that</i> give him to be a hero? Why,
    they might as well lend him the key and done with it. Picks and
    shovels&mdash;why, they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, then," I says, "if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do we
    want?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "A couple of case-knives."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the <i>right</i> way&mdash;and
    it's the regular way. And there ain't no <i>other</i> way, that ever I
    heard of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about
    these things. They always dig out with a case-knife&mdash;and not through
    dirt, mind you; generly it's through solid rock. And it takes them
    weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever. Why, look at one
    of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor
    of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was <i>he</i> at it, you
    reckon?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "I don't know."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, guess."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "I don't know. A month and a half."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "<i>Thirty-seven year</i>&mdash;and he come out in China. <i>That's</i> the kind.
    I wish the bottom of <i>this</i> fortress was solid rock."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "<i>Jim</i> don't know nobody in China."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "What's <i>that</i> got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow.
    But you're always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can't
    you stick to the main point?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "All right&mdash;I don't care where he comes out, so he <i>comes</i> out; and Jim
    don't, either, I reckon. But there's one thing, anyway&mdash;Jim's
    too old to be dug out with a case-knife. He won't last."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes he will <i>last</i>, too. You don't reckon it's going to take
    thirty-seven years to dig out through a <i>dirt</i> foundation, do you?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "How long will it take, Tom?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't take
    very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He'll
    hear Jim ain't from there. Then his next move will be to advertise
    Jim, or something like that. So we can't resk being as long digging
    him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple
    of years; but we can't. Things being so uncertain, what I recommend
    is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after
    that, we can <i>let on</i>, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years.
    Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's
    an alarm. Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Now, there's <i>sense</i> in that," I says. "Letting on don't cost
    nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind
    letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn't strain
    me none, after I got my hand in. So I'll mosey along now, and smouch
    a couple of case-knives."
</p>

    <img alt="c35-307.jpg (48K)" src="./images/c35-307.jpg"><br>
</div>

<p class="quote">
    "Smouch three," he says; "we want one to make a saw out of."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it," I says,
    "there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the
    weather-boarding behind the smoke-house."
</p>

<p>
    He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and
    smouch the knives&mdash;three of them." So I done it.
