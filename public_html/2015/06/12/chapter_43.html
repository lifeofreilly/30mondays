<p class="firstparagraph">
    <span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time
    of the evasion?&mdash;what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked
    all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free
    before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we
    got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft,
    and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him
    about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
    and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the
    niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
    procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we.
    But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.
</p>

<p>
    We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
    Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,
    they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
    all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had
    him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty
    dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and
    Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:

<p class="quote">
    "Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?&mdash;what I tell you up dah on Jackson
    islan'? I <i>tole</i> you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en
    I <i>tole</i> you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich <i>agin</i>; en it's come
    true; en heah she is! <i>dah</i>, now! doan' talk to <i>me</i>&mdash;signs is
    <i>signs</i>, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be
    rich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!"
</p>

<p>
    And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three
    slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
    howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple
    of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain't got no
    money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get none from home,
    because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got it all away from
    Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No, he hain't," Tom says; "it's all there yet&mdash;six thousand dollars
    and more; and your pap hain't ever been back since. Hadn't when I
    come away, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
    Jim says, kind of solemn:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck."
</p>

<p>
    I says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, Jim?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Nemmine why, Huck&mdash;but he ain't comin' back no mo."
</p>

<p>
    But I kept at him; so at last he says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a
    man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you
    come in? Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase
    dat wuz him."
</p>

<p>
    Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard
    for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't
    nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd a
    knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and
    ain't a-going to no more. But I reckon I got to light out for the
    Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me
    and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.
