    <span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hen they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and
    says:
</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
    "Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our company,
    hey?"
</p>

<p>
    I says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "No, your majesty, we warn't&mdash;<i>please</i> don't, your majesty!"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Quick, then, and tell us what <i>was</i> your idea, or I'll shake the insides
    out o' you!"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.
    The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying
    he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to
    see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise
    by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and
    whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit out. It
    didn't seem no good for <i>me</i> to stay&mdash;I couldn't do nothing, and I
    didn't want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped
    running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,
    or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke
    wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful
    glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't."
</p>

<p>
    Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, "Oh, yes,
    it's <i>mighty</i> likely!" and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he'd
    drownd me. But the duke says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would <i>you</i> a done any different?
    Did you inquire around for <i>him</i> when you got loose? I don't
    remember it."
</p>

<p>
    So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it.
    But the duke says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "You better a blame' sight give <i>yourself</i> a good cussing, for you're the
    one that's entitled to it most. You hain't done a thing from the
    start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with
    that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That <i>was</i> bright&mdash;it was right
    down bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn't
    been for that they'd a jailed us till them Englishmen's baggage come&mdash;and
    then&mdash;the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to the
    graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the
    excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look
    we'd a slept in our cravats to-night&mdash;cravats warranted to <i>wear</i>, too&mdash;longer
    than <i>we'd</i> need 'em."
</p>

<p>
    They was still a minute&mdash;thinking; then the king says, kind of
    absent-minded like:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Mf! And we reckoned the <i>niggers</i> stole it!"
</p>

<p>
    That made me squirm!
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Yes," says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, "<i>we</i> did."
</p>

<p>
    After about a half a minute the king drawls out:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Leastways, I did."
</p>

<p>
    The duke says, the same way:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "On the contrary, I did."
</p>

<p>
    The king kind of ruffles up, and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?"
</p>

<p>
    The duke says, pretty brisk:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was <i>you</i> referring
    to?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Shucks!" says the king, very sarcastic; "but I don't know&mdash;maybe you
    was asleep, and didn't know what you was about."
</p>

<p>
    The duke bristles up now, and says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Oh, let <i>up</i> on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?
    Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "<i>Yes</i>, sir! I know you <i>do</i> know, because you done it yourself!"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "It's a lie!"&mdash;and the duke went for him. The king sings out:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Take y'r hands off!&mdash;leggo my throat!&mdash;I take it all back!"
</p>

<div class="fig">
    <img alt="c30-263.jpg (54K)" src="./images/c30-263.jpg"><br>
</div>

<p>
    The duke says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, you just own up, first, that you <i>did</i> hide that money there,
    intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it
    up, and have it all to yourself."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Wait jest a minute, duke&mdash;answer me this one question, honest and
    fair; if you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and
    take back everything I said."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't. There, now!"
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, then, I b'lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more&mdash;now
    <i>don't</i> git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide
    it?"
</p>

<p>
    The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Well, I don't care if I <i>did</i>, I didn't <i>do</i> it, anyway. But you not
    only had it in mind to do it, but you <i>done</i> it."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest. I won't
    say I warn't goin' to do it, because I <i>was</i>; but you&mdash;I mean somebody&mdash;got
    in ahead o' me."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "It's a lie! You done it, and you got to <i>say</i> you done it, or&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
    The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "'Nough!&mdash;I <i>own up!</i>"
</p>

<p>
    I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier
    than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and
    says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "If you ever deny it again I'll drown you. It's <i>well</i> for you to set
    there and blubber like a baby&mdash;it's fitten for you, after the way
    you've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble
    everything&mdash;and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own
    father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear
    it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.
    It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to <i>believe</i>
    that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make
    up the deffisit&mdash;you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the
    Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it <i>all</i>!"
</p>

<p>
    The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't me."
</p>

<p class="quote">
    "Dry up! I don't want to hear no more out of you!" says the duke.
    "And <i>now</i> you see what you GOT by it. They've got all their own
    money back, and all of <i>ourn</i> but a shekel or two <i>besides</i>. G'long to
    bed, and don't you deffersit <i>me</i> no more deffersits, long 's <i>you</i> live!"
</p>

<p>
    So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,
    and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
    hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
    lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms. They
    both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow enough
    to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That
    made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring
    we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.
